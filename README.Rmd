# Chill projections for South America

This repository contains the code and part of the data generated to assess the impacts of climate change in South America. After projecting future temperatures, we computed chill accumulation at each location.

In earlier steps, we identified all available weather stations in South America. Information regarding these weather stations was obtained from the Global Surface Summary Of the Day database ([GSOD](https://data.noaa.gov/dataset/dataset/global-surface-summary-of-the-day-gsod)) by accessing functions contained in the `chillR` package [@R-chillR]. This procedure resulted in about 1,500 available weather stations.

To keep using those weather stations having a good amount of data, we filtered the weather stations with 90% of complete records between 1980 and 2017. Additionally, we added a number of weather stations from different databases (i.e. a Chilean - through the `dormancyR` package [@R-dormancyR] - and Argentinean database). This addition yielded about 157 weather stations.

The next task is to interpolate chill accumulation between stations and produce a raster map. However, we need to identify reliable and plausible proxies to be used in the interpolation procedure.

Lars and Ilja are on board now...
